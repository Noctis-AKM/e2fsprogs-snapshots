config NEXT3_FS_SNAPSHOT
	bool "Next3 snapshot awareness"
	help
	  There are no snapshot COW operations during offline processing,
	  only restrictions on changing a file system with snapshots offline.

config NEXT3_FS_SNAPSHOT_ON_DISK
	bool "Next3 on-disk format changes"
	help
	  Next3 uses a few reserved fields and flags in the Ext2 super block,
	  and inode structs.
	  Next3 defines the compatible feature 'exclude_inode', meaning that
	  the special exclude inode was allocated.
	  Next3 defines the read-only compatible features 'has_snapshot', meaning
	  that the file system contains snapshots.

config NEXT3_FS_SNAPSHOT_BIG_JOURNAL
	bool "Create a big journal for Next3"
	help
	  Next3 transactions reserve up to 24 times more credits than Ext3
	  transactions for the same operation.  On mke2fs and tune2fs, if the
	  '-J big' option is used to create a journal, increase the default
	  journal size by a factor of 24.

config NEXT3_FS_SNAPSHOT_EXCLUDE_INODE
	bool "Create/check exclude inode for Next3"
	help
	  The exclude inode owns all the exclude bitmap blocks.
	  It is pre-allocated by 'mke2fs/tune2fs -O exclude_inode'.
	  It is extended by resize2fs when block groups are added.
	  Fsck checks that all exclude inode blocks are allocated.

config NEXT3_FS_SNAPSHOT_CTL
	bool "Next3 snapshot control with chattr/lsattr -X"
	help
	  Set/clear snapshots parent directory with chattr +/-x.
	  Take/delete snapshot with chattr -X +/-S.
	  Enable/disable snapshot with chattr -X +/-n.
	  View snapshot status with lsattr -X.

config NEXT3_FS_SNAPSHOT_HAS_SNAPSHOT
	bool "Avoid offline modifications to a file system with snapshots"
	help
	  Next3 sets the read-only compatible feature 'has_snapshot',
	  so the file system could be mounted with Ext3 only in read-only mode
	  to protect the snapshots.
	  Fsck displays a warning about possible corruption of the snapshots
	  in interactive mode and avoids freeing blocks in preen mode.

config NEXT3_FS_SNAPSHOT_CLEANUP
	bool "Cleanup Next3 snapshot list when removing has_snapshot feature"
	help
	  Discard all snapshots by 'tune2fs -O ^has_snapshot'.
	  Snapshot inodes are chained on a list starting at the super block.
	  Delete all snapshot inodes on the list and reset exclude bitmap.

config NEXT3_FS_SNAPSHOT_EXCLUDE_BITMAP
	bool "Check Next3 exclude bitmap on fsck"
	help
	  Excluding blocks is done by setting their bit in the exclude bitmap.
	  There is one exclude bitmap block per block group.  The exclude
	  bitmap blocks are owned by the special exclude inode.
	  Fsck checks that all (and only) snapshot file blocks are excluded.

config NEXT3_FS_SNAPSHOT_CHECK_LIST
	bool "Check Next3 snapshot list on fsck"
	help
	  Check that all inodes on snapshot list are valid snapshots and
	  prompt to terminate list when bad inode is found.

config NEXT3_FS_SNAPSHOT_FIX_SNAPSHOT
	bool "Delete all snapshots on fsck -x"
	help
	  On fsck -x or if the 'fix_snapshot' flag is set, prompt to delete
	  all snapshot inodes and reset exclude bitmap.

config NEXT3_FS_SNAPSHOT_HUGE_SNAPSHOT
	bool "Map maximum filesystem size with a single snapshot file"
	help
	  To map 2^32 logical blocks, 4 triple indirect blocks are used instead
	  of just one.  The extra 3 triple indirect blocks are stored in-place
	  of direct blocks, which are not in use by snapshot files.
	  Snapshots cannot be enabled on filesytem with block size < 4K.

config NEXT3_FS_SNAPSHOT_MESSAGE_BUFFER
	bool "Dump Next3 message buffer on fsck"
	help
	  Next3 error messages are recorded in a 2K message buffer after the
	  journal super block.  On journal recovery, the journal message buffer
	  is copied to the file system message buffer.  On fsck, if the message
	  buffer is not empty, the recorded messages are printed to stdout and
	  the buffer is cleared.
	  Next3 supports only block size of 4K, so there is always 2K of free
	  space for the message buffer after the 1K super block.

config NEXT3_FS_SNAPSHOT_ON_DISK_MIGRATE
	bool "Migrate old to new on-disk format"
	help
	  Detect old 'has_snapshot' feature on ext2fs_open(), migrate snapshot
	  fields and flags and set new 'has_snapshot' feature.
	  Detect old 'exclude_inode' feature on create/check_exclude_inode(),
	  copy old exclude inode to new exclude inode location and set the new
	  'exclude_inode' feature.
